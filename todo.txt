* restart the game on F5
* addiction system (deplete state of mind, death of exhaustion, death of overdose)
* gain will while killing Anxieties
* irresistible doses
  - the irresistible area glows
* variable state of mind bonus for doses
* map exploration (dark arena, uncovers slowly)
* graphical effect of high/withdrawn
* bonuses on superhigh
  - see entities on som >= 98
  - uncover the entire map on som == 99
* generate a new area when stepping over the edge of the screen


* read-up on the format!, println! and writeln! macros
* don't use uint for non-size variables
* remove `TCOD_` from all the tcod.rs types
* Customise the starting area (no solid ground, no monsters near, a drug nearby)

* add the entity id in the Map as a generic type
  - maybe do the same for position?
  - This requires the extern callback to tcod_find_path_using_function to be
  generic (because the map is generic and we need to cast the `*void user_data`
   to `Map<T>`) and that's hitting a compiler bug.
