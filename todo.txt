* BUG: Replay broken when the player is stunned
* generate a new area when stepping over the edge of the screen
* a safe initial area (no monsters, dose in sight)
* map exploration (dark arena, uncovers slowly)
* graphical effect of high/withdrawn
* background glow for the irresistible area around a dose
* bonuses on superhigh
  - see entities on som >= 98
  - uncover the entire map on som == 99


* read-up on the format!, println! and writeln! macros
* don't use uint for non-size variables
* remove `TCOD_` from all the tcod.rs types
* Customise the starting area (no solid ground, no monsters near, a drug nearby)

* add the entity id in the Map as a generic type
  - maybe do the same for position?
  - This requires the extern callback to tcod_find_path_using_function to be
  generic (because the map is generic and we need to cast the `*void user_data`
   to `Map<T>`) and that's hitting a compiler bug.
