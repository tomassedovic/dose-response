* map exploration (dark arena, uncovers slowly)
* graphical effect of high/withdrawn
* background glow for the irresistible area around a dose
* bonuses on superhigh
  - see entities on som >= 98
  - uncover the entire map on som == 99

* wrap tcod::console_t if feasible

* write a generic system interface so we can simplify the `update` function.
* write a defsystem macro that handles the system boilerplate?
* add the entity id in the Map as a generic type
  - maybe do the same for position?
  - This requires the extern callback to tcod_find_path_using_function to be
  generic (because the map is generic and we need to cast the `*void user_data`
   to `Map<T>`) and that's hitting a compiler bug.
