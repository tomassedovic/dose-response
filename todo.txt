* addiction system (deplete state of mind, death of exhaustion)
* doses (can use them, increase tolerance, overdose)
* AI system
  - follow when player gets near
  - pack AI for Hunger
* special monster attacks
  - stun
  - panic
  - attribute drain
* the bottom info bar
* graphical effect of high/withdrawn
* irresistible doses
  - the irresistible area glows
* map exploration (dark arena, uncovers slowly)
* gain will while killing Anxieties
* kill nearby monsters on dose use
* bonuses on superhigh
  - see entities on som >= 98
  - uncover the entire map on som == 99
* generate a new area when stepping over the edge of the screen


* read-up on the format!, println! and writeln! macros
* don't use uint for non-size variables
* remove `TCOD_` from all the tcod.rs types
* Customise the starting area (no solid ground, no monsters near, a drug nearby)

* add the entity id in the Map as a generic type
  - maybe do the same for position?
  - This requires the extern callback to tcod_find_path_using_function to be
  generic (because the map is generic and we need to cast the `*void user_data`
   to `Map<T>`) and that's hitting a compiler bug.
