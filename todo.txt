* graphical effect of high/withdrawn
* background glow for the irresistible area around a dose
* bonuses on superhigh
  - see entities on som >= 98
  - uncover the entire map on som == 99
* improve level generator not to create blocked entities
* add different levels

* BUG: the game is a bit jerky sometimes
  - doesn't seem to be a (purely) AI thing. Even when we replaced AI for a
  random destination the problem persisted.
  - when we set AI to just always wait, the hangs were still occasionally there.
  They could have been rarer, but they also just may have been harder to notice
  (because the only thing moving was the player)
* wrap tcod::console_t if feasible
* replace Map with Position caching on the ComponentManager level


* write a generic system interface so we can simplify the `update` function.
* write a defsystem macro that handles the system boilerplate?
* add the entity id in the Map as a generic type
  - maybe do the same for position?
  - This requires the extern callback to tcod_find_path_using_function to be
  generic (because the map is generic and we need to cast the `*void user_data`
   to `Map<T>`) and that's hitting a compiler bug.
