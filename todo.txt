* a safe initial area (no monsters, dose in sight)
* map exploration (dark arena, uncovers slowly)
* graphical effect of high/withdrawn
* background glow for the irresistible area around a dose
* bonuses on superhigh
  - see entities on som >= 98
  - uncover the entire map on som == 99

* rename GameObject to Entity
* drop the `idle_ai` system and fix the game instead

* read-up on the format!, println! and writeln! macros
* don't use uint for non-size variables
* remove `TCOD_` from all the tcod.rs types
* Customise the starting area (no solid ground, no monsters near, a drug nearby)

* write a generic system interface so we can simplify the `update` function.
* write a nicer interface/macros to ECM
* write a defsystem macro that handles the system boilerplate?
* add the entity id in the Map as a generic type
  - maybe do the same for position?
  - This requires the extern callback to tcod_find_path_using_function to be
  generic (because the map is generic and we need to cast the `*void user_data`
   to `Map<T>`) and that's hitting a compiler bug.
