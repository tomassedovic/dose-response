* Gameplay priority
** Stun and Panic don't do anything right now
** Player should die on Overdose
** Monsters should switch back to Idle if the player is too far away
** Irresistible dose effect
** Fog of war (radius dependent on State of Mind)
** Colours should go wild when the player is High
** Add bonuses on superhigh
  - see entities on som >= 98
  - uncover the entire map on som == 99
** Food should give a bit of State of Mind back but never increase intoxication
** When the PC is drawn to an irresistible dose
they must walk through the monsters if that's the shortest path even if it means death
* Other gameplay ideas & plans
** Depression only moves by 2 squares when following the player
** Gameplay beyond the first screen
*** We need a greater pressure for exploration and leaving the area.
**** In my current playthroughs I just never care enough to leave.
**** consider tweaking the intoxication gain and drop to create stronger pressure
*** Hey, like, just a though: What about an infinite world instead of discrete screens?
**** may (suprisingly) provide more variety
**** would fit the exploration feel I'm going for
**** no need to figure out special exit handling, etc. Just go as far as you can/want.
*** Add different worlds the player can go to when leaving the map
**** this could either be completely random
**** or there may be a fixed or semi-fixed sequence (e.g. 2 tree worlds, than two other worlds, then three different worlds, etc.)
**** Some notes on different world generation:
http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/31241/random-map-generation/31245#31245
*** consider restricting the possible ways to leave the map
** More effects on High
*** monsters get weaker (Dempression moving by one step per turn)
*** dynamic / changing environment?
** improve level generator not to create blocked entities
** Don't allow suicide (if there's a way to avoid it)
*** e.g. fatfingering the arrow when the Depression is near
** save&exit/load game
* Polish (UI & stuff)
** Shadows & Voices should fade out when dying after attack
** Animate food & dose explosions (like in Cogmind)
** Display the SoM textual representation (overdosed, high, withdrawn) in the status bar
** Doses should glow
** Trees should vary in colours
** Player should fade when dying
** Background around a dose should glow in the Irresistible radius
** Uncover and unfade the screen on player death
** Stop the High colour animation on player death
** Better display the movement of D monsters:
  - they're moving too fast currently (FPS dependent)
  - we should show a path trail
  - and also slow them down (visually -- so like they move every say 200ms, not every tick)
** Smooth animations for the fade-out when growing Withdrawn
** Change the rate of the `High` animation based on intoxication
  (very high: fast-paced, should slow down on the way to sobriety)
** Better effects on player's death:
*** Fade out to red/black completely
*** Uncover the entire map (with a reverse fade)
    - with full colours
    - showing player's corpse
** Make the graphics on Overdose death glitchy
** Better radious / FoV calculation
Instead of looking at the points' coordinates, look at the actual (pixel) space
each tile represents. The tiles are not points but squares with an area. This
should provide a visually better result (but will be harder to compute).
** Pick a good colour palette
** Add the Marla Daniels quote
  - When the game is launched and there aren't any saves, it should just jump into the play
    * (that was the genius of Braid)
    * (we can use the unexplored area to show help/hints)
  - Any other time, we'll show the menu with the quote & the load-game option
  - Possibly, we may show it during player's death, if it makes sense
** Effects on hit/death
   - colour fade (or something) on stun, removed will, death, etc.
** Change player's colour on stunned/panicked
** Make sure we're accessible to colour blind people
* Code cleanup & improvements
** Refactor food and dose explosion code to a single location
** Update each actor in every frame
** Clean up the monster list / level cache?
   - was a huge source of bugs, maybe we want to tighten it up more?
** Get rid of int/uint -- they're platform specific, just use i32 or whatever appropriate
** Use libtcod.cfg for config to libtcod.cfg
   - that way we won't have to implement a lot of options UI
   - http://doryen.eptalys.net/data/libtcod/doc/1.5.1/html2/parser_run.html?c=true
   - should properly commented, suggesting available font options and such
   - Examples:
     - font path
     - font size
     - fullscreen (yes/no)
     - key bindings
     - colour-blind mode (yes/no)
     - location to the replays
     - location to the saved games?
